# **Howdy! Welcome to our HowdyHack 2024 Project: Horse Racing Betting Predictor**

## **Inspiration**

We initially saw the western theme and got thinking about what we should do. As engineering students, we tend to gravitate towards money and this lead us to making a project about horse racing.

## **What it does**

Uses a neural network trained on previous data to predict future race results.

## **How we built it**

We used tensor flow for the model and hosted it on flask to use on our website

## **Challenges we ran into**

Time and knowledge of the technologies

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We made a model that had 97% accuracy

## **What we learned**

We learned how to train a neural network on data

## **What's next for Student Loan Repayer 5000**

More accuracy, more money
